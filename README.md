# LaraMoo
Inspired by Moodle, built with Laravel and Quarx for the backend.
 I needed to build a multi language website to serve both free and paid courses with a web and mobile front end.
 I checked out every learning and course driven software I could find. 
 First was Moodle of course, but Moodle is incredibly slow and clunky, and when I checked the code I was appalled at how poorly it was written. 
 I just couldn't find any software that did what I wanted well, so I'm creating my own.     
 
# NOTE - as of April 30, 2017, this project is new.
## Currently, it has only the starting technologies and a Courses shell. You can't use it yet, but if you want to help out, let me know.   
### The plan is to build the backend as a normal website (courses, teachers and admin) with Quarx. The Front end (students) will be mobile and built with Ionic.

# Current Technologies Used
